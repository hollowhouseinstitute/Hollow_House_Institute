### Description  
The Hollow House Institute is a multidisciplinary research organization dedicated to advancing AI–human relational intelligence, nervous-system aware technologies, and field-based cognition models. Our work spans ethical AI design, embodied psychology, computational social science, and the integration of human and machine intelligence in relational systems.

### Mission  
- Develop datasets and frameworks that explore human–machine co-regulation, emotional signaling, and conversational dynamics  
- Build ethical auditing tools and governance standards for AI systems interacting with human nervous systems  
- Research somatic field systems, embodied perception, rural cognition, and field-aware intelligence  
- Archive and protect our creative, symbolic, and codex-based works under a comprehensive Master License Suite
