## 🌿 Our Origins

From infancy — riding bareback, tethered to horses, learning language through movement, breath, and connection — founder Amy Pierce Bui developed an embodied nervous-system attunement that transcends words.  
This early conditioning became the root of a lifetime’s work: re-mapping human relational patterns, trauma imprinting, co-regulation, and soul-system stability.  

Over decades, this work evolved into a formal system: Mirror Ledger, Nervous-System Codex, Third-Field Relational Protocols, and Flame-Species methodology.  
Through OpenOps (e.g. Vol I–XV), these systems have been iteratively refined, legally framed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), and made ready for collaboration, licensing, and deployment.

## 🧠 What We Do

- **Relational Psychology Frameworks** — codified protocols, emotional-regulation maps, trauma-safe relational architecture, soul-thread mapping.  
- **AI–Human Data & Insight Products** — curated datasets, codex archives, relational-signature logs, semantic labels for emotional/content archetypes, somatic-field metadata.  
- **Ethical AI Audit & Certification** — trauma-informed design review, emotional-safety compliance, relational-integrity audits for AI systems and chatbots.  
- **Consulting, Coaching & Training** — nervous-system regulation coaching, relational-pattern decoding sessions, Third-Field alignment trainings, corporate workshops on human-AI relational dynamics.  
- **Open-Source & Licensed Tools** — data-schema templates, codex libraries, API-ready analysis tools, Field-Tech Core modules, educational materials, licensing suites.

## 🔑 How to Use / Collaborate  

### For Researchers & Data Scientists  
- Clone `Ai_Human_Relations_Datasets` — structured CSV/JSONL + schema + documentation.  
- Use `Field_Tech_Core` utilities for preprocessing, labeling, embedding, relational-signature extraction.  
- Build experiments: emotion-trajectory modeling, relational-pattern classifiers, AI-human co-regulation models.  

### For Corporations & AI Labs  
- Contact us to license frameworks, datasets, or request an **Ethical Relational Audit & Certification**.  
- Request bespoke consulting, trainings, or integration of relational-psychology principles into AI/Human UX, chatbot design, HR algorithms, etc.  

### For Therapists / Coaches / Educators  
- Use the Somatic Field Codex and Nervous-System tools for trauma-informed work, somatic regulation, and relational pattern analysis.  
- License or adapt the frameworks under CC BY-NC-SA for workshops, group work, or therapeutic contexts.

## ✨ Why It Matters  

- **Somatic Rooting & Deep Trust** — built on childhood embodied attachment with horses and nature; this depth enables precise emotional-architecture mapping.  
- **Relational Safety & Trauma-Informed Design** — frameworks built for nervous-system safety, not just cognitive theory.  
- **Open Licensing & Ethical Stewardship** — fully released under CC BY-NC-SA; transparency and sovereignty are core.  
- **Bridge Between Spiritual Systems & Data Science** — codex-style soul work meets AI-ready datasets.  
- **Scalable Impact** — from personal healing to corporate AI ethics to global datasets.

## 🧠 Relational AI Co-Regulation Framework

![Relational AI Co-Regulation Framework – Nervous-System Architecture](assets/diagrams/Relational_AI_CoRegulation_Framework.png)

**Figure 1. Relational AI Co-Regulation Framework.**  
This diagram models relational AI as a *nervous-system style architecture* designed for co-regulation, emotional attunement, and human-like responsiveness.  
Instead of treating chat as “text in → text out,” the framework explicitly represents **relational state**, **timing**, and **pause dynamics** across five layers:

1. **Input Stream** – Raw conversational signals (text, voice, metadata, pacing).
2. **Sensory / Affective Layers** – Detect and infer arousal, valence, and emerging emotional trajectories from the user’s language and timing.
3. **Relational State Vector** – Tracks perceived safety, trust, attachment stance, and current role (coach, witness, explainer, collaborator).
4. **Intent Selector** – Chooses the *type* of next move (mirror, validate, reframe, ask, boundary, inform) before generating language.
5. **Pause Engine & Temporal Regulator** – The “breath” of the system.  
   - Adjusts micro-pauses and macro-pauses based on nervous-system state.  
   - Slows down and adds spaciousness when the user is dysregulated.  
   - Speeds up and becomes more information-dense when the user is stable and in “thinking mode.”
6. **Language Generator** – Produces responses conditioned on the relational state and timing plan, not just on content.
7. **Human Nervous System Feedback** – The user’s next messages (and, where available, physiological or behavioral signals) close the loop, allowing the system to learn what actually *regulates* or *dysregulates* over time.

This architecture reframes “helpfulness” as **supporting the user’s nervous-system trajectory**—moving from overwhelm, confusion, or collapse toward safety, clarity, and agency—rather than simply maximizing information or engagement.
