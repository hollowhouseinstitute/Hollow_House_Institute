## Repository Role

This repository is the canonical governance and coordination anchor for the
Hollow House Institute ecosystem.

| Repository | Role | Structure |
|-----------|------|-----------|## Research Navigation
## System Overview Diagram (Planned)

A high-level diagram illustrating the relationship between governance,
research execution, datasets, analysis, and published papers will be
maintained here:

📊 `docs/diagrams/hollow_house_research_stack.png` *(planned)*

This diagram will provide a visual trace from:
Governance → Theory → Protocols → Data → Analysis → Papers → Archive

Diagram inclusion is deferred until the research stack reaches v1.0
structural stability.

Primary research artifacts are maintained in downstream repositories:

- **Research Papers**  
  https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/hollowhouse-research-papers

- **Datasets**  
  https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/hollowhouse-datasets-core

- **Analysis & Methods**  
  Referenced within individual research repositories under `4_ANALYSIS`.

Each research repository follows a standardized chronological structure:

0_ADMIN → 1_THEORY → 2_PROTOCOLS → 3_DATASETS → 4_ANALYSIS → 5_PAPERS → 6_TOOLS → 7_APPENDIX

| Hollow_House_Institute | Governance, policy, ethics, standards | Non-chronological |
| hollowhouse-research-papers | Primary research execution | Chronological (0–7) |
| hollowhouse-datasets-core | Curated datasets | Chronological (aligned) |
| hollowhouse-tools | Tooling & pipelines | Functional |
| hollowhouse-standards-library | Shared standards & schemas | Functional |

Research chronology is implemented **only** in downstream research repositories.

# Hollow House Institute

## Canonical Repository
This repository serves as the canonical governance and policy anchor.
Research chronology is implemented in downstream research repositories.

Hollow House Institute is a research and governance organization focused on the development of licensed, ethically governed relational datasets, frameworks, and tooling for AI–human systems. This repository is the primary, authoritative entry point for the Institute.

## Purpose & Scope
- Maintain canonical architecture, governance standards, licensing, and releases.
- Define institute-wide policies and reference implementations.
- Coordinate cross-repo integration, certification, and audits.

## Repo layout
- docs/ — governance, policies, and standards
- legal/ — license texts and license index
- releases/ — official release artifacts
- examples/ — integration examples and templates

## Getting started
1. Review docs/01_Start_Here.md
2. Read the Master License Suite in the legal/ folder
3. Open issues for governance proposals or repo changes

## Contributing
See CONTRIBUTING.md for code and policy contribution guidelines. Contributions require a brief ethics impact statement and license compliance checklist.

## License
See legal/LICENSE.md and Master_License_Suite repository for institute licensing norms.
