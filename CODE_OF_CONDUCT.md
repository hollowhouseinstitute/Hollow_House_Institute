Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:

## 📍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:

- In public spaces when representing the project or community
- When using official project communication channels

## 🚨 Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:
- Opening a private issue (if safe to do so)
- Contacting maintainers directly via GitHub
- Using the contact methods listed in the repository

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, with respect for privacy and safety of all parties.

**Confidentiality:** We will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter's identity unless required by law or with explicit permission.

## ⚖️ Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines when determining consequences:

### 1. Correction
**Impact:** Minor inappropriate language or unprofessional behavior.  
**Consequence:** Private, written warning with clarity about the violation and explanation of why it was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Impact:** Violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
**Consequence:** Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved parties for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact:** Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** Temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with involved parties is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, aggression toward individuals, or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
**Consequence:** Permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.

## 🌱 Restorative Justice Approach

When appropriate, Hollow House Institute may use restorative justice practices that:
- Center the safety and needs of those harmed
- Hold accountable those who caused harm
- Repair relationships and community trust
- Support learning and growth

This aligns with our trauma-informed values and nervous-system-centered approach.
