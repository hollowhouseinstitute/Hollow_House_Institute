# Coming Soon

This repository is currently an overview for the Hollow House Institute. Several documentation pages and dataset-specific docs are planned but not yet available. To avoid broken links while the content is created, this page serves as a single landing page that lists the planned documents and their status.

Planned pages (TODO):

- docs/licensing.md — Licensing overview and dataset license links
- docs/access_and_pricing.md — Researcher access, pricing, and application process
- docs/dataset_store.md — Catalog/index of dataset repos and status
- docs/ai_safety_policy.md — AI safety policy and usage restrictions
- docs/researcher_access_application.md — Researcher access application form and instructions
- docs/enterprise_terms_of_service.md — Enterprise terms and licensing
- docs/data_broker_disclosure.md — Data broker disclosure and third-party sharing rules
- docs/ethics_and_limits.md — Ethics and permitted uses
- docs/anonymization_protocol.md — Anonymization protocol and procedures
- docs/model_card_template.md — Model card template for derived models
- docs/dataset_card_template.md — Dataset card template for dataset metadata
- docs/investor_dataset_summary.md — Investor-facing summaries of datasets

If you are working on any of these pages and want them published early, move the content into its corresponding file and this README will link directly to it in future commits.
