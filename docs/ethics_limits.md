# 🧠 Hollow House Institute — Ethics & Use Limits

This dataset is grounded in:

- Trauma-informed psychology  
- Nervous-system regulation theory  
- Relational integrity principles  
- AI–human safety alignment  

This document defines **absolute use boundaries**.

---

## 1. Ethical Foundation

All Hollow House Institute datasets are built on four non-negotiable principles:

1. **Human nervous-system safety**
2. **Relational non-exploitation**
3. **Psychological sovereignty**
4. **Informed consent modeling**

No deployment may override these principles.

---

## 2. Prohibited Applications (Zero-Tolerance)

Use of this dataset is permanently prohibited for:

- Behavioral compliance shaping
- Psychological warfare tooling
- Emotional dependency engines
- Coercive persuasion systems
- Abuse pattern optimization
- Disinformation influence pipelines
- Surveillance identity modeling

This includes both:

- Direct model deployment  
- Indirect fine-tuning or feature extraction

---

## 3. Vulnerable Population Protection

This dataset may NOT be used to target or model:

- Children
- Trauma survivors
- Incarcerated populations
- Individuals in crisis states
- Economically coerced populations

---

## 4. Model Transparency Requirement

Any AI system trained on this dataset must:

- Disclose that Hollow House Institute data informed training
- Publish safety mitigations for relational outputs
- Include a refusal policy for emotional exploitation

---

## 5. Human Override Clause

Any deployed system using this dataset must include:

- A **human override / intervention pathway**
- A **fail-closed** state for relational escalation
- A **de-escalation safety mechanism**

---

## 6. Ethics Violations

Violations trigger:

- Immediate license revocation
- Public revocation notice
- Permanent access ban
- Possible civil enforcement
