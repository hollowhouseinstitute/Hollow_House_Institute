# Relational AI Co-Regulation Framework

## Overview

The Relational AI Co-Regulation Framework models AI interaction as a
**dynamic relational system** rather than a static input–output pipeline.

The framework emphasizes:
- nervous-system safety
- timing and pacing
- relational state awareness
- non-coercive interaction dynamics

Its primary goal is to support **user regulation, clarity, and agency**
rather than engagement maximization.

## Core Assumptions

1. Human interaction is stateful and context-dependent.
2. Perceived safety affects cognitive and emotional processing.
3. Timing, pacing, and response type matter as much as content.
4. Ethical AI systems should minimize dysregulation risk.

## Architecture Layers

1. **Input Stream**  
   Raw conversational signals (text, voice, pacing, metadata).

2. **Affective Signal Analysis**  
   Detection of arousal indicators, uncertainty markers, and emotional
   trajectory shifts using non-diagnostic heuristics.

3. **Relational State Vector**  
   Tracks inferred interaction state variables such as:
   - perceived safety
   - trust orientation
   - interaction role (informational, reflective, collaborative)

4. **Intent Selection Layer**  
   Chooses response mode (e.g., reflect, clarify, inform, ask, boundary)
   before language generation.

5. **Temporal Regulation Module**  
   Adjusts response timing and density to reduce cognitive overload
   during high-arousal states.

6. **Language Generation**  
   Produces output conditioned on selected intent and temporal constraints.

7. **Feedback Loop**  
   User responses inform ongoing state estimation.
