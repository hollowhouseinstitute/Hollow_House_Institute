## 4. Commercial / Enterprise Use

The default license is **non-commercial**. That means:

## 5. Dataset-Specific Terms

Some datasets (especially heavily anonymized AI–human logs) may include:

These additional constraints will be documented in each dataset’s own repository under:

- `data/metadata/anonymization_protocol.md`  
- `data/metadata/usage_notes.md`  
- or a `DATASET_LICENSE.md` file

When there is a conflict between:
