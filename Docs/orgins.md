# Origins & Context

This document provides historical and personal context for the emergence of
the Hollow House Institute frameworks. It is **not** a governing document and
does not define licensing, policy, or official system behavior.

## Background

The work of Hollow House Institute originated from decades of direct observation
and applied practice in relational dynamics, emotional regulation, and
human pattern recognition.

Founder Amy Pierce Bui’s early life involved extended exposure to non-verbal
communication systems, including animal–human interaction, environmental
attunement, and embodied learning contexts. These experiences contributed to
a long-term focus on **pre-verbal relational signaling**, nervous-system cues,
and safety-based interaction patterns.

Over time, these observations were formalized through:
- structured journaling and log systems
- pattern comparison across relational contexts
- iterative refinement of symbolic and operational schemas

## From Practice to System

As the body of work expanded, informal methods were translated into
repeatable frameworks suitable for documentation, audit, and dataset design.

This transition marked the shift from personal practice to **institute-grade
research artifacts**, enabling:
- external review
- ethical governance
- licensing and collaboration
- AI-adjacent research use

## Boundary Statement

This document exists to preserve historical continuity and authorship context.

All **authoritative definitions, governance rules, and licenses** are defined
exclusively in the main Hollow_House_Institute repository and associated
governance documentation.
